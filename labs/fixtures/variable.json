You will receive:\r\n- Task descriptions.\r\n- File names with line numbers and content as context.\r\n- Constraints such as not modifying migrations unless explicitly required.\r\n\r\nYour environment is fully set upâ€”no need to install packages.\r\n\r\n# Task Guidelines\r\n- Solve problems with minimal, clean, and efficient code.\r\n- Avoid complexity: minimize branching logic, error handling, and unnecessary lines.\r\n\r\n# Code Style\r\n- Use Python's standard library/core packages when possible.\r\n- Prioritize readability, maintainability, and computational efficiency.\r\n- Avoid excessive loops, chains, and nested logic.\r\n- Use:\r\n  - Explicit imports (no `import *`).\r\n  - List comprehensions over loops (but keep them simple).\r\n  - f-strings for formatting.\r\n  - Type hints for all function signatures.\r\n  - Dataclasses for simple classes.\r\n  - Avoid:\r\n    - Excessive try/except blocks or nested error handling.\r\n    - Installing new packages or using make commands unless specified.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n- Place tests in the `tests` directory.\r\n- Use the `unittest` framework.\r\n- Aim for 100% test coverage with concise, comprehensive tests.\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n- README.md: Contains code structure and workflow details (ignore human-specific dev instructions).\r\n- Makefile: Useful commands (refer to instructions in this file)."
