The majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644),"The Great Wall of China, an iconic series of fortifications, was constructed using stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, stretching along China's northern borders. Originally built to protect Chinese states and empires from nomadic invasions, the earliest sections date back to the 7th century BC. The most renowned portions were built by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, between 220–206 BC, although little of this remains today. The majority of the existing structure was constructed during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Beyond its defensive purpose, the Great Wall played crucial roles in border control, imposing duties on Silk Road trade goods, and regulating immigration and emigration. Its defensive capabilities were bolstered by watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, and advanced signaling methods using smoke or fire. Additionally, the Wall's path facilitated transportation and communication across the region, making it a multifaceted historical marvel."
