        Project Definition: Name Processor\r\n\r\n### Project Overview\r\nThe Name
        Processor project is designed to read a list of names from an input file,
        process the data by sorting the names and removing duplicates, and then write
        the cleaned list to an output file. This project serves as an introduction
        to file handling, data manipulation, and error handling in Python.\r\n\r\n###
        Objectives\r\n- **Read Input**: Read names from a specified input file.\r\n-
        **Process Data**: Sort the names alphabetically and remove any duplicate entries.\r\n-
        **Write Output**: Write the processed list of names to a specified output
        file.\r\n- **Error Handling**: Handle common file I/O errors gracefully.\r\n\r\n###
        Functional Requirements\r\n1. **Input File Handling**:\r\n   - Read a list
        of names from a file named `input_names.txt`.\r\n   - Ensure that each name
        is stripped of extra whitespace.\r\n\r\n2. **Data Processing**:\r\n   - Remove
        any duplicate names from the list.\r\n   - Sort the names in alphabetical
        order.\r\n\r\n3. **Output File Handling**:\r\n   - Write the processed names
        to a file named `output_names.txt`.\r\n   - Each name should be written on
        a new line.\r\n\r\n4. **Error Handling**:\r\n   - Handle the case where the
        input file does not exist and provide a user-friendly error message.\r\n   -
        Handle any other potential I/O errors gracefully.\r\n\r\n### Non-Functional
        Requirements\r\n- The script should be written in Python 3.\r\n- Code should
        be modular and organized into functions for readability and reusability.\r\n-
        The script should include appropriate comments and documentation.\r\n\r\n###
        Project Deliverables\r\n1. **Python Script**: A fully functional Python script
        (`name_processor.py`) implementing the specified features.\r\n2. **Input File**:
        A sample `input_names.txt` file for testing purposes.\r\n3. **Output File**:
        An `output_names.txt` file generated by the script after processing the sample
        input.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Plan\r\n1. **Setup**:\r\n   - Create the
        project directory.\r\n   - Create the initial script file (`name_processor.py`).\r\n   -
        Create a sample input file (`input_names.txt`) with test data.\r\n\r\n2. **Develop
        Functions**:\r\n   - Implement `read_names_from_file` to read names from the
        input file.\r\n   - Implement `process_names` to remove duplicates and sort
        the list.\r\n   - Implement `write_names_to_file` to write the processed names
        to the output file.\r\n\r\n3. **Error Handling**:\r\n   - Add error handling
        in `read_names_from_file` for file not found and other potential errors.\r\n   -
        Add error handling in `write_names_to_file` for potential write errors.\r\n\r\n4.
        **Testing**:\r\n   - Test the script with a valid input file.\r\n   - Test
        the script with an invalid or missing input file to ensure error handling
        works.\r\n   - Verify the output file contents.\r\n\r\n5. **Documentation**:\r\n   -
        Add comments to the script explaining each function and key sections of the
        code.\r\n   - Write a README file explaining how to use the script.\r\n\r\n###
        Timeline\r\n- **Day 1**: Setup project directory, create initial script file,
        and develop `read_names_from_file` function.\r\n- **Day 2**: Implement `process_names`
        and `write_names_to_file` functions.\r\n- **Day 3**: Add error handling and
        test the script with various input scenarios.\r\n- **Day 4**: Write documentation
        and finalize the project.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n- **Development Tools**:
        Python 3, a text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).\r\n- **Documentation**:
        Python''s official documentation, tutorials on file handling and error handling
        in Python.\r\n\r\n### Risk Management\r\n- **File I/O Errors**: Mitigated
        by implementing robust error handling.\r\n- **Data Quality**: Ensure names
        are stripped of whitespace and duplicates are removed through the `process_names`
        function.\r\n\r\n### Success Criteria\r\n- The script reads names from `input_names.txt`,
        processes them correctly, and writes the sorted, deduplicated list to `output_names.txt`.\r\n-
        The script handles missing files and other errors gracefully.\r\n- The code
        is well-documented and easy to understand.\r\n\r\nBy following this project
        definition, we can ensure that the Name Processor project is implemented effectively
        and meets all specified requirements.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lmoreira-runtime/lm-rag-onboarding/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lmoreira-runtime/lm-rag-onboarding/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lmoreira-runtime/lm-rag-onboarding/issues/2","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lmoreira-runtime/lm-rag-onboarding","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lmoreira-runtime/lm-rag-onboarding/issues/2/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lmoreira-runtime/lm-rag-onboarding/issues/2/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lmoreira-runtime/lm-rag-onboarding/issues/2/events","html_url":"https://github.com/lmoreira-runtime/lm-rag-onboarding/issues/2","id":2360280506,"node_id":"I_kwDOMEpq7M6MrwW6","number":2,"title":"Project
